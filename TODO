TODO: voting, crawling, scores page

task 1: signup page
DONE!

task 2: voting page
(we don't actually need this until late May or June)

 * also gated by OpenID : DONE-ish?
 * HTML mockup of voting page
 * database schema
 * HTML mockup of results pages
 * again we need a spec from the full mod team
 * new todo items once we are closer to the goal
 * we have a possible algorithm here: http://pastebin.com/ETQiyec9

task 3: dreamwidth crawling
DONE!
although it needs to be cleaned up and made accessible

other things we might want to do:

 * something that assigns mods to teams for liaisoning:
   this should be easy but I haven't thought about it much yet
   and how easy it is will depend on the db schema
 * some sort of drop form mirroring the signup form : this sort of works you can just enter "remove"
 * an online spreadsheet or similar that shows everyone's current score
