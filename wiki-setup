We made a wiki for the rules; it's hosted on autumnfox. If you want to make
your own wiki you can do that too! Here's what I did:

1. install python-moinmoin package via debian apt
2. Create and populate /var/www/mywiki
    # mkdir /var/www/mywiki
    # mkdir /var/lib/mywiki
    # cp -r /usr/share/moin/data /usr/share/moin/underlay /var/lib/mywiki
3. Pass on the wiki to Apache:
    # chown -R www-data: /var/www/mywiki /var/lib/mywiki
4. edit the default apache config to include the wiki:

        # trying to make moinmoin work for HSWC
        Alias /moin_static194/applets/FCKeditor/ "/usr/share/fckeditor/"
        Alias /moin_static194/ "/usr/share/moin/htdocs/"
        ScriptAlias /hswcrules "/usr/share/moin/server/moin.cgi"

   that goes in the virtual host in /etc/apache2/mods-available/whatever
4b.if instead we had a separate hostname we could follow the instructions
   to make that work in /usr/share/doc/python-moinmoin/README.Debian.gz
   but I'm a rebellious youth who flaunts the rules so I didn't do that
   also I don't know if I want to buy a domain name for this yet
5. Configure MoinMoin:
   Edit /etc/moin/mywiki.py to include these lines:

        sitename = u'MyWiki' # [Unicode]
        data_dir = '/var/lib/mywiki/data'
        data_underlay_dir = '/var/lib/mywiki/underlay'
        superuser = [u"YourName", ]
5b.the docs say to do this and I did:
    Edit /etc/moin/wikilist to include this line:

        www-data wiki.example.org/
   but I am pretty sure that's pointless here
6. /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
7. Visit your new wiki at http://your.site/MyWiki/LanguageSetup
    then create you account (name according to the superuser you specified
    above).
8. Install the language pack you want to use (typically, you want to install
    the "all_pages" pack in English, plus the languages use in your wiki).
   I did the all_pages English
9. Turn off creation of new accounts, it's the best way to prevent spam
   and users being wrong on the Internet:
    # stop new accounts being created
    import MoinMoin.config.multiconfig # if not already included in your config file
    actions_excluded = MoinMoin.config.multiconfig.DefaultConfig.actions_excluded + ['newaccount']
   the docs were unclear about where this _belongs_ but you can put it in
   /etc/moin/mywiki.py at the end within Config  and it's fine

almost everywhere you want to sub "hswcrules" or something for "mywiki"
but the file /etc/moin/mywiki.py should actually be called mywiki.py unless
you have multiple wikis on the server in which case you should know what
you are doing more than me or at least spend more time with the real 
moinmoin documentation

why is the name mywiki sometimes structural and sometimes a placeholder?
because tech writing is dead guy fieri killed it

<3,

-r.
