TODO: everything

task 1: signup page

 * get OpenID proof of concept up
 * HTML mockup of signup page
 * HTML mockup of nope you have no openID page
 * can we have it reject openID that isn't DW?
 * HTML mockup of final spreadsheet
 * database schema
 * make sure everyone agrees on spec for how signup actually works
 * make new todo items once we are closer to the goal

task 2: voting page

 * also gated by OpenID
 * HTML mockup of voting page
 * database schema
 * HTML mockup of results pages
 * again we need a spec from the full mod team
 * new todo items once we are closer to the goal

task 3: dreamwidth crawling

 * hoo boy
 * hairy
 * made of hair
 * it's like Jade/Condesce up in here
 * this is lower priority so think about it more later

other things we might want to do:

 * something tht assigns mods to teams for liaisoning:
   this should be easy but I haven't thought about it much yet
   and how easy it is will depend on the db schema
 * some sort of drop form mirroring the signup form
