## Assumptions about the database are currently:

# sqlite> .schema
# CREATE TABLE pending(dwname TEXT, email TEXT, team TEXT, friendleader TEXT, notes TEXT, extrafield TEXT);
# CREATE TABLE players(dwname TEXT, email TEXT, tumblr TEXT, team TEXT, friendleader TEXT, flwilling TEXT, notes TEXT, extrafield TEXT);
# CREATE TABLE teams(name TEXT, active TEXT, friendleader TEXT, member1 TEXT, member2 TEXT, member3 TEXT, member4 TEXT, member5 TEXT, member6 TEXT, member7 TEXT, member8 TEXT, member9 TEXT, member10 TEXT, member11 TEXT, member12 TEXT, member13 TEXT, totalscore INT, round1 INT, round2 INT, collab INT, bonus0 INT, bonus1 INT, bonus2 INT, bonus3 INT, bonus4 INT, bonus5 INT, bonus6 INT, bonus7 INT, extrafield TEXT);

## this is minorly belunkus but it's a starting point at least
## in particular the players table doesn't need 'flwilling'
## and having it be dwname and name in different tables is _kind_ of
## stupid although also a reminder of which table you're working with

## extrafield is there in case I forgot something and need to insert it 
## in the middle of the event, which is probably the sort of thing you 
## only do when you are writing hackity nonsense for shipping competitions, 
## but that's what I'm doing so here we are
